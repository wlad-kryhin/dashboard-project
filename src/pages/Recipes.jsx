        Method Peel the onion and roughly chop with the mushrooms. Put a 30cm
        non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Season the steak with sea salt and
        plenty of black pepper and rub with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Turning
        with tongs, sear the steak all over for 2 minutes in total, then remove
        to a plate. Return the pan to a medium heat with the onion and
        mushrooms. Strip in the thyme. Cook for 15 minutes, or until soft,
        stirring regularly. Blitz in a food processor until spreadable, season
        to perfection, and remove. Blitz 1 egg, the flour, spinach, a pinch of
        salt and 1 mug of water in the processor until smooth. Put your pan back
        on a medium heat, rub with oil, then pour in a thin layer of batter.
        Cook for 1 minute on each side without colour. Tip on to a plate to
        cool. Cover the leftover batter and chill for breakfast or brunch.
        Preheat the oven to 220°C. Sit your pancake on a large sheet of
        clingfilm. Evenly spread over the mushroom pâté. Place the steak in the
        centre, then gather up the clingfilm and twist into a parcel. Sit the
        wrapped steak (clingfilm discarded) on the pastry, 2cm from one side.
        Eggwash all the pastry, then fold and mould the excess over the wrapped
        steak, leaving a pastry border around it. Trim to 2cm, pinch the edges
        to seal, eggwash, and decorate with the trimmings, if you like. Cook on
        the bottom of the oven for 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden on
        top and crispy underneath, for blushing, juicy beef. Rest for 2 minutes,
        then serve.
